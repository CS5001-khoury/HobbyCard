# Homework 1: Welcome to CS5001

First before you start this homework assignment, make sure you complete the syllabus quiz! You won't be able to turn in this homework until you score a 4 of 4 on the quiz. Now let's start. Part of this homework will be auto-graded and parts will be graded via TAs. You will have four points possible for this assignment, each corresponding to a Tier Mastery category (see the syllabus!). It is pretty common to have 3 points with the autograder and the final point being your manually graded point. 


## Task 0: Downloading the Homework

First, you should go ahead and download this entire repository. To do that, follow these steps:

1. go to [https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/HobbyCard](https://github.com/CS5001-khoury/HobbyCard)
2. click on the green `code` button, and go to `download zip`. 
3. Download the zip file
4. Extract the file (often by right clicking you have that option)
5. Move the created folder to a location you can easily find on your computer
6. Open the folder in VS Code

## Task 1: warm-up - Star Rating App

Use the provided template file called [star_rating.py](../src/star_rating.py). The file has logical errors in it, but you should be able to load to still run it as is. If you run the file without changes, it should output the following:

```text
1 star rating: 
2 star rating:
3 star rating:
3 star rating:
3 star rating:

My star rating is

Help on function five_star in module __main__:

five_star()
    sets five * to the variable stars.
```

The final solution output should look like

```text
1 star rating: *
2 star rating: **
3 star rating: ***
4 star rating: ****
5 star rating: *****

My star rating is *****

Help on function five_star in module __main__:

five_star()
    sets five * to the variable stars.
```

### Let's get started

You will see a lot of `functions` in the code. While we will cover these later in the course, we separated the warm-up into these functions, so you can think of your code in 'blocks' doing one thing at a time.

> [!TIP] 
> Always make sure to read through all provided code, and express what it does in your own words.  
> Pros use comments in the code to do that, and not sure yet is  a valid answer!

üëâüèΩ **Your Tasks**  
1. You should change each function to set the correct number of stars to the variable `stars` 
   * You don't need to modify anything else, just the one line!
   * You should use the string multiplication operator (review the lecture 1.7 on concatenation)
2. Find the logical errors in ` get_rating_block()`, fix them


### Testing 

Testing is important, and often an overlooked part of the development process. For the first few assignments we will provide the test files we use in the autograder. Eventually, you will be building your own tests. To test star_rating.py, go to test_star_rating.py, and run that file in VS Code. You will see a lot of text printed out by default. 

For example:

```text
line 21, in test_one_star
    self.assertEqual(expected, actual, msg="Double check the number of stars")
AssertionError: '*' != ''
- *
+
 : Double check the number of stars
 ```

 What this is saying is in line 21 (of the tests) it was expecting `*` but instead got the empty string ``. This means you should check what function line 21 is calling, and then check to see what the error is. Tests give you a clue, but you often have to do more detective work to find the error.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should NEVER write *all* your code and then test. Instead, work on one function and test, make sure that function works and then continue on. 
> Arguably, us providing the tests may encourage you to write all your code at once, as such, you have to resist the urge to do that. 
> It willnot help you in the future, and often will make it harder to if you don't develop "incrementally". 




### Task 2: Hobby Card

Use the file  [hobby_card.py](../src/hobby_card.py) to start out. You will be building a `string` made up of additional strings. Once again,
review the lecture on concatenation. As a reminder to help you out, you can do something like the following:

```python
card = "This is my line\n"
card = card + "this is my second line"

print(card) # you should not be using print in your hobby_card.py unless it is to debug
```

would print to the screen
```text
This is my line
this is my second line
```

Even better, you can also modify the above to use shortcut assignments to produce the exact same result, but easier to read!

```python
card = "This is my line\n"
card += "this is my second line"

print(card) # you should not be using print in your hobby_card.py unless it is to debug
```

üëâüèΩ **Task** - Build a card that lists your name and your hobbies. However, you have to meet the following conditions with the card.

1. the total width / length of the card is 32 characters
2. First and last row: 30 dashes (`-`) and a plus (`+`) signs on each corner
2. Each other row uses a bar `|` to start and end
3. The second row will have centered "A Hobby Card" (case matters!)
4. The third row will have your name (as in your actual name, or a nickname if you have a particularly long name)
5. You will have an empty row
6. Followed up by up to three hobbies listed
   1. Indent 4 spaces before your first hobby

Here is a templated example:
```text
+------------------------------+
|         A Hobby Card         |
| Your Name                    |
|                              |
|    hobby1, hobby2, hobby3    |
|                              |
+------------------------------+
```

Along with a finished example:

```text
+------------------------------+
|         A Hobby Card         |
| Albert Lionelle              |
|                              |
|    Fencing, D&D, Writing     |
|                              |
+------------------------------+
```

> [!TIP]  
> Run the program frequently as you are building the card. It will be *much* easier to get it correct.  
> Even when writing the solution, we ran the code **every time we created a new line**. 

 
## Task 3: Readme.md Report.md Questions

üëâüèΩ **Task** Answer the questions in [README.md](../README.md) and [Report.md](../Report.md).

To open an `.md` (markdown) file, it needs a simple text editor. Thankfully, VS Code can open Markdown files and display them using a preview, so you can easily format your code. The contents of the file are meant to be simple text to read, but you will notice there is some special formatting in the file. This is called markdown, and it is a simple way to format text. You can learn more about markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). These instructions were written in markdown. 

For your README.md, you do not need to worry about most the formats! The TAs will read the raw text in the file. However, you should make sure to answer the questions in your own words, and not just copy and paste from the internet. You can use the internet to help you, but make sure to cite your sources. 

As a reminder with the grading system, it is often all or nothing. Meaning if there is a small thing the TA wants you to fix, they will respond with a comment in gradescope making a suggestion on what to fix. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You are free to ask about these questions in MS Teams chat! They are not meant to be super secret. Don't share your answers, but instead discuss the questions and what they mean - and point towards resources that can help others. 


## üìù Grading Rubric


1. Learning (AG)
   * each star rating function returns the correct number of stars
2. Approaching  (AG)
   * `main()` function fixed in star_rating.py with proper spacing
3. Meets  (AG)
   * Hobby Card completed with proper formatting
   * Both files pass style check (ran on autograder side)
4. Exceeds  (MG)
   * Uses `*` concatenation or string  f-formatting for creating stars
   * Properly assigns the variables without additional prints or unneeded assignments
   * Properly updates docstrings in all files
   * Properly answered questions in [README.md](../README.md) and [Report.md](../Report.md)


AG - Auto-graded  
MG - Manually graded

### Submission Reminder üö®
For manually graded elements, we only guarantee time to submit for a regrade IF you submit by the DUE DATE. Submitting late may mean it isn't possible for the MG to be graded before the AVAILABLE BY DATE, removing any windows for your to resubmit in time. While it will be graded, it is always best to submit by the due date, so you have full opportunity to improve your grade.

* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Python Functions Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) - just the first part

### Functions

Python by default excutes code in the as it sees it. As such, if your file looks like

```python
x = "x"
print(x * 10)
```

It will print `x` 10 times to the screen. However, if you want to reuse code, you can use functions. Functions are a way to group code together, and then call it later. For example, you can do the following:

```python

def print_x_times_10():
    x = "x"
    print(x * 10)


print_x_times_10()
print_x_times_10()
```

Will print `x` 10 times to the screen, twice. One import concept to notice is the "block" required in python. You will see every line after `def` is indented, that means it is part of that function block. You will also see the `print_x_times_10()` is not indented, so it is not part of the function block. 

#### Return Values

You can also return a value with a function. The idea is something that gets repeated, and you get an answer out of it. For example

```python
def get_10_stars():
   return '*' * 10

stars = get_10_stars()
print(stars)
```

Will print

```text
**********
```

The `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function. For now, you just need to focus on making sure your code blocks remain together. In Week 3, we will deal more with functions, and you will find they are often the heart of your programming. Small simple functions can be added together to do amazing things!
